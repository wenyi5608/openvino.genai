Discussion in 'Mac OS X Lion (10.7)' started by axboi87, Jan 20, 2012.\nI've got a 500gb internal drive and a 240gb SSD.\nWhen trying to restore using disk utility i'm given the error \"Not enough space on disk ____ to restore\"\nBut I shouldn't have to do that!!!\nAny ideas or workarounds before resorting to the above?\nUse Carbon Copy Cloner to copy one drive to the other. I've done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won't be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that's mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\nI've actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\nThanks for pointing this out. My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn't fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data.

Sysco Corp. has terminated its planned $3.5 billion takeover of US Foods, it announced Monday, after a federal judge blocked the combination. The company is opting instead to add $3 billion to its stock-buyback program.\nWith the deal breaking up, Sysco will pay a $300 million termination fee to US Foods and a $12.5 million fee to Performance Food Group, which had agreed to buy some US Foods facilities. Sysco, based in Houston, plans to make the share repurchases over the next two years.\nRosemont, Illinois-based US Foods operates a major distribution center in Fishers. Sysco has a large warehouse at 4000 W. 62nd St., in Indianapolis.\nSysco had fought for more than a year to gain government approval for the transaction, which antitrust regulators said would hurt competition and lead to higher prices. Sysco and US Foods dominate a market known as broadline foodservice, which supplies school cafeterias, restaurants and hotels. Sysco had argued that the acquisition would bring $1 billion in savings, letting it offer lower prices to customers.\nInvestors have responded with relief to the deal’s demise, reflecting concerns about the company undertaking an ambitious merger. Sysco shares rose 3.1 percent the day the transaction was halted by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, and the stock climbed again Monday morning after the merger was withdrawn.\nMehta blocked the merger on June 23 when he granted a Federal Trade Commission request to delay the transaction. The FTC had sued the companies in February, saying the deal would give Sysco an oversized share of an industry where it’s already the biggest player.\nIn arguments before Mehta in May, the two sides clashed over the scope of the market in which the companies compete. Sysco and US Foods argued that the commission was relying on a “tortured” analysis, ignoring the variety of distribution channels available to customers.\nSysco said on Monday that it weighed embarking on an appeal but decided against it.\nShares of Sysco rose as much as 1.6 percent to $39 in early trading. The stock had slid 3.3 percent this year through the end of last week.
